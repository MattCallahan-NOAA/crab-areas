# crab-areas
These scripts were developed to append SST data to Bering Sea crab management areas.

crab_area_sst.R creates new spatial objects for each crab area and joins them to the existing spatial lookup table for coral reef watch SST.
2019 SST is brought in and attributed to crab area for demonstration. Only the pre-aggregated data is presented here as the full file was over a GB.

crab area EDA.R does some exploratory data analysis on the crab areas. 
It compares boundaries between different layers in the crab area file geodatabase, old shapefiles for St. Matt and Bristol Bay, and station points.
